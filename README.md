This project aims to build a website that facilitates the resume selection process both for students and the working class. We aim to integrate it with machine learning models and other api's
# RESUME PARSER
A utility to make handling many resumes easier by automatically pulling contact information, required skills and custom text fields. These results are then surfaced as a  convenient job for the given information.
Resume parsing refers to the automated storage, organization and analysis of job resumes. Resume parsing software provides companies an efficient way to identify keywords, skills, and so forth, in order to sort through large quantities of applications to identify the best applicants.
# How does the parse work?
After we signup to the website, It asks for different skills we know which is given as input string to the ML Model.
This string would be passed onto the ML Model and It gives us back the appropraite as the output. We would also upload our Resume into it.
Henceforth our resume would also be Rated based on the content and format in it.
